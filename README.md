# Micro-Service-Architecture-Containerisation-


### ### What is Micro service architecture?
- A microservices architecture is a type of application architecture where the application is developed as a collection of services. It provides the framework to develop, deploy, and maintain microservices architecture diagrams and services independently.

### What is containerisation ?
- Containerization is a form of virtualization where applications run in isolated user spaces, called containers, while using the same shared operating system (OS). 
- One of the benefits of containerization is that a container is essentially a fully packaged and portable computing environment.

### What is Docker ?
- Docker is a software platform that simplifies the process of building, running, managing and distributing applications.
- It does this by virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.


### Benefits of Containerisation and Docker:
- Caching a cluster of containers.
- Flexible resource sharing.
- Scalability - many containers can be placed in a single host.
- Running your service on hardware that is much cheaper than standard servers.

### When to use Docker:
- Microservices-based apps
- Pre-deployment application testing
- Early application development
- Multi-cloud or hybrid cloud applications

### When not to use Docker:
- Security considerations.
- GUI applications
- Small-scale deployments



## Virtualisation V/S Containerisation:
- Virtualization enables you to run multiple operating systems on the hardware of a single physical server, 
   while containerization enables you to deploy multiple applications using the same operating system on a single virtual machine or server.
